        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">BiologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">   My name is Raymond Zeng and was born and raised in San Francisco, California. I am a second generation Asian American who grew up in the middle class. Coming from this background I believe in the values of honesty, perseverance,  and being genuine. Being honest and genuine allows for less complication. Perseverance is what I have learned coming from my first generation parents. You must work hard and overcome challenges in life to be successful, especially when you do not have much. I do my best to follow these values because no one is perfect.<br>
    My current goals are to finish college with a grade of at least a 3.0 and getting an internship during my college years. I want to hold myself up to high standards because I want to be giving the things I do a maximum amount of effort. I want an internship so that I can have experience in the real world. An internship would also set me up with a job offer or better job offers which I would be looking for after college. I want to do these things while keeping up with other things I enjoy doing such as volleyball, exercising, and poker. I have played volleyball for about four years now and am on the club team at UC Riverside. Volleyball is a good form of exercise, but I also enjoy running, hiking, swimming, weightlifting, and biking. Poker is a hobby that I have picked up not too long ago and it may not seem like a good hobby to have because it essentially is gambling. For me, poker is not about gambling, it is about having fun with friends, good decision making, analyzing the choices of your opponents, making the right decisions, and thinking one step ahead of another player. These are skills that would be helpful in the real world.<br>
    My goals in the future are to make enough money to live comfortably by doing something that I enjoy doing and travel. As of now, I do not specifically know what I love to do, so it may be a challenge to find that in the coming years. I would say I am not a very materialistic person, I just need a couple things to be happy. I want to travel around the world to experience different cultures and foods.
    My current professional experiences are working at a frozen yogurt shop and Old Navy. The froyo place was my first job, so I learned a lot about working with customers, teamwork, and time management. Sometimes it was just me and one other person working and there would be a long line of people waiting to purchase their yogurt, so we had to work together efficiently to get through all these people. We communicated with each other, telling each other what we needed and what needed to be handled. I was a quiet kid, so working with customers taught me to be more vocal. I also learned how to professionally deal with unhappy customers through either giving an explanation of the issue or providing compensation. Old Navy mostly taught me about customer service and trying to get people to join their rewards program or credit card. This taught me a little bit about how to get someone to buy something.<br>
